Dedupe is a library and not a stand-alone command line tool. To
demonstrate its usage, we have come up with a few example recipes for
different sized datasets for you to try out.

You can view and download the source code for these examples in the
`examples repo <https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples>`__.
